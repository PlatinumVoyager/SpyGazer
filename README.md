# SPYGAZER
Intra/Internetworked Information Gathering Toolset all within the comfort of your browser.

### Built With:
* [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) - a lightweight WSGI micro web-framework used by the web application for path/request routing functionality.
    * *Web Server Gateway Interface* (WSGI) - standard specification (PEP 3333) upon which servers and python web applications/frameworks can communicate. Read more [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/).
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - for the user-interface, files are hosted statically by SPYGAZER.
* `gevent`, `geventwebsocket` for client-side request routing throughout the front-end (Bottle) web application server.
* Client-side Javascript for communicating with the python WSGI websocket server.
* Made with ❤️

*Release?* (TBD)
