## üîç What is SPYGAZER?

SPYGAZER (PeekingGlass Server) is an HTTP-based application-layer (L7) server that provides **deep situational awareness** of the local subnetwork it operates within. It is engineered to offer a unified, interactive dashboard for observing, managing, and extending visibility into devices, protocols, and communication behaviors across a network.

Rather than passively monitor, SPYGAZER is designed to function as a **central intelligence node** ‚Äî a "spyglass" into the digital terrain of the current environment.

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

* **Modular Dashboard** ‚Äì Dynamically view network topology, system processes, engagement tools, and backend access points.
* **Process Intelligence** ‚Äì Interact with and manage server-side processes through a robust internal manager.
* **Web Shell Access** ‚Äì Seamless backend shell access from within the dashboard (e.g. subshell panel, redirectable viewport).
* **Future Scope:**
  * Network Manager (Wireless AP/Client view, rogue access point handling)
  * Device Behavior Fingerprinting.
  * Live packet-based notifications or triggers.
  * Extendable modules for engagement or research actions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture:
* [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) - a lightweight WSGI micro web-framework used by the web application for path/request routing functionality.
    * *Web Server Gateway Interface* (WSGI) - standard specification (PEP 3333) upon which servers and python web applications/frameworks can communicate. Read more [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/).
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - for the user-interface, files are hosted statically by SPYGAZER.
* `gevent`, `geventwebsocket` - for server-side request routing throughout the front-end (Bottle) web application server.
* Client-side Javascript for communicating with the python WSGI websocket server.
* Designed for deployment on **personal, lab, or red team subnets**.
* Embedded HTTP server logic with a dynamic frontend.
* Lightweight footprint and highly customizable modules.

## üìú Ethical Use Policy

SPYGAZER is intended **strictly for use in authorized environments** ‚Äî networks you own or are explicitly permitted to audit, test, or research. While its capabilities are powerful, its purpose is to enable **defensive research, diagnostics, education, and controlled experimentation.**

Any unauthorized deployment or use may violate local, state, or federal law.

> "Power without ethics corrupts absolutely. SPYGAZER's vision is only as righteous as the hands it serves."

## üîÆ Development Philosophy

SPYGAZER is being built as both a **creative lab project** and a **potential platform for advanced security research.**
* **Public Path**: Secure, ethical, and open-source components intended for community collaboration, learning, and experimentation.
* **Private Path** *(Optional)*: Reserved features for controlled environments, adversarial emulation, and highly customized infrastructure operations.

## üìÅ Repository Status
* üõ†Ô∏è Active Development.
* :closed_lock_with_key: Code is currently private.

## üìå Author

Created and maintained by [PlatinumVoyager](https://github.com/PlatinumVoyager).

### <ins>Release?</ins> 
*To be determined.*

## üìë Documentation
The associated documentation will be available/produced as:
   * A `.pdf` (Portable Document File) file subsequently made accessible when the project is open sourced with a public release coming in version 1.0.0.
   * A Github markdown based "wiki" page. (*NOTE*: This will be posted shortly after the `.pdf` file is integrated into this public repository)
     
   * Each subsequent main route (i.e, /spygazer/subshell, /spygazer/dashboard) will have available help upon clicking the associated button.
      * This will include general documentation for the current page, and a listing breakdown of the functionality of said page.
      * Documentation for the entire SPYGAZER web application may be built into the server directory itself at a later point in time.

> [!WARNING]
> *All images depicted are a work-in progress and are not final.*

### <ins>Weekly Snapshot Update</ins>:
*A WSU is simply a screenshot of the current development process.*
* This snapshot instance (as seen below) has been tested and confirmed to run on a base [Raspberry PI 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/).

### > <ins>*Login Page*</ins>
The SPYGAZER authentication portal (login page) has a purposefully sleek and generic graphical interface. 
<br>
* Features a "blacked out" form entry feature that disables the viewing of ANY characters, input, etc.

### > <ins>*Process Manager*</ins> (OLD UI Mockup)
*The old user interface for the SPYGAZER Process Manager before it was programatically implemented within the primary application interface.*

It simply means this was built within a separate HTML document then ported over through the Python/JS backend. Take a look below nonetheless:

### > <ins>*Process Manager*</ins> (Dashboard Integration OLD)
*The old UI Mockup has been successfully integrated within the primary application. This rough draft shows the evolution of complex software. Let this be known as Stage 1 of the official web interface.*

### > <ins>*Process Manager*</ins> (Dashboard Integration NEW)
*This sets the stage for Stage 2 of the official SPYGAZER web application interface. This is the version you will see going forward with the development cycle.*

* Added the ability to search through processes for information which concerns the following:
   * Name of the process.
   * Status of the process: *Running*, *Sleeping*, *Idle*. (ALL supported process state types can be seen in the image below)
      * ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0f96036-e237-4401-bdd5-a6526f37cbc5)
   * Process states can be filtered with the click of a button via the "Process Stats" dropdown menu within the Process Managers sub-window context.
   * ANY/* other text that is contained within the bounds of the process container.

### > <ins>*Websocket System Subshell*</ins> (work-in progress)
* Support for CSS (*Cascading Style Sheets*) font-family and font-size custom user defined declarations via JavaScript DOM manipulation will come before release.

### > <ins>*Responsive Layout Positioning*</ins> (Mobile Operators)
> [!NOTE]
> For remote clients using a mobile device, custom JavaScript and CSS styling has been built into the application beyond that of the original bootstrap base functionality. This will correctly position elements justly to accomodate for a narrower virtual viewport.
